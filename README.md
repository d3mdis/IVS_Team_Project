# IVS Team Project

  Simple calculator with some default functions such as addition, subtraction, muliplication, division and others.<br/>
  Made with Python and Flet framework.
  
## Requirements:
  Python 3.7+, pip, Pyinstaller module

## How does it work?

  This repo contains two separated applications: calculator.py and profiling.py. Both of them are using our mathematical library.
  1. Git clone this repository
  2. Unzip and cd into it
  3. Run "make" command
  4. Done. Now you have two runnable applications. 
  
## Usage:
  
  Calculator:<br/>
    - type in numbers and operands with buttons on screen or input them with keyboard<br/>
    - for further help use "book" icon button
    
  Profiling:<br/>
    - run in terminal!(opening the app normally would cause it being shutdown right after last input)<br/>
    - type in numbers inline with whitespace or tabs between them or one number in each separeted line<br/>
    - stdin takes as much arguments as you want to provide<br/>
    - the result can be calculated after pressing ENTER with empty string('')<br/>
